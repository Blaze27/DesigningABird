A Low Level Design of a Bird.

Structure of the repo are as follows:
  v1
  v2
  v3
  v4
  v5

In each version, we have implemented a solution; faced some challenges; and introduced a new version. Each version upto v4 faces some challenges while extensing the code base,
introducing new features, etc.

In the v5; I've followed all design principles in order to make code readable, understandable, extensible, easy to test, etc.
